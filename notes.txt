- Bash starts while loop
	- while loop calls Perl
		- Perl calls Bash
			- Bash grabs/dumps statuses
		- Perl parses statusts
		- Perl outputs statuses
	- Statuses are dumped in WWW area


- web browser requests JavaScript functions file
	- one of the functions loads the status...
	- ...and it continuously re-checks the statuses
	- updates display on page as necessary

	
All places code might have to change,
 whenever we change out a projector for a different brand,
  or one with a different number of lamps,
   or something like that:
- Perl file
- "status" HTML file on Extron box
- "control" HTML file on Extron box
- JavaScript variables file
- midnight off script
